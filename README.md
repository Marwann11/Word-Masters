# Welcome to **WordMasters**!

## Project Description
In this Project, I have created a *guessing word game*, which is a client-side web application based on the famous game _Wordle_.


## Project Features
- Word-Guessing: players can try to guess a **_five-letter_** word within a total of **_six_** attempts.

- Word-Validation: the application validates the guessed word and checks if the word is a valid english **_five-letter_** word.

- Feedback: provide feedback for the player for each guessed letter, to indicate if the **letter is in the word** and if it's **at the right position**

- Smooth-UX: interface is designed **with** a focus on **accessability**, **performance** and **mobile responsiveness**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **Sass**
- **Vanilla JS**

## Dependencies
- **API**: The project relies on an API provided by Frontend Masters website For **_word of the day selection_** and **_word validation_**

_Feel free to explore the project and have fun guessing words_ ðŸ’™
